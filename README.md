# Use Router in React App

## Project Overview

This React project demonstrates the use of React Router, a popular routing library, to enable navigation and dynamic content rendering in a single-page application (SPA). With React Router, you can create dynamic, client-side navigation and display different components based on URL changes, making your web application more interactive and user-friendly.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Routing:** Utilizes React Router's routing capabilities to handle URL-based navigation within a single-page application.

- **Navigation Links:** Provides navigation links using `Link` and `NavLink` components to enable users to switch between different views or pages.

- **Nested Routing:** Demonstrates how to nest routes and render specific components for each nested route.

- **Route Parameters:** Shows how to capture and use route parameters to create dynamic and data-driven views.


### Technologies Used

- **React:** This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React Router:** Utilizes the React Router library to manage client-side routing and navigation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/arasidobariya/react-router.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-router`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Start the development server: `npm start`

The app can be accessed in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

- **Changing Routes:** Navigate between different views by clicking on the navigation links provided in the app.

- **Nested Routes:** Explore how nested routes work by following the links and observing how different components are rendered for each route.

- **Route Parameters:** Experiment with route parameters by visiting routes with dynamic segments, such as `/user/:userId`.

Thank you for exploring our React Router example project. We hope it helps you understand how to implement client-side routing in your React applications!
